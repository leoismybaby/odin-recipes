    <h6>Juicy delicious tonkatsu.</h6>
    <p>Tonkatsu is a delicious Japanese dish consisting of breaded and fried pork cutlets. Boneless pork loins or pork chops are dredged in flour and egg, then coated in Japanese bread crumbs called 'panko'. It's typically served with tonkatsu sauce, thinly shredded cabbage, and steamed rice.</p>
