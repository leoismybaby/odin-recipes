    <h4>A delicious bowl of pho in all its glory</h4>
    <p> Pho is a Vietnamese soup consisting of bone broth, rice noodles, and thinly sliced meat (usually beef). It may also be served with bean sprouts, fresh herbs, limes, chiles, and other garnishes. The origins of pho are a bit murky, but it is generally believed to have originated in early 20th century northern Vietnam.</p> <p>Pho usually has a clear beef broth made from bones and meat that's flavored with star anise and cloves for a subtle spice. Rice noodles: These flat noodles are delicate in texture and usually cooked separately to prevent them from getting mushy.</p>
