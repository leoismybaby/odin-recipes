    <h5>A photo of delicious miso salmon.</h5>
    <p>Salmon fillets marinated in a mixture of miso, sake, and soy sauce, then cooked under the broiler. </p> <p> This miso salmon is fresh fish fillets soaked in a flavorful marinade, then broiled to perfection and topped with sesame seeds. A unique and delicious main course option that takes just minutes to put together! </p> <p>I'm looking for fresh ways to serve up salmon, I turn to family favorite salmon recipes such as almond crusted salmon, honey glazed salmon, broiled salmon and this flavorful miso salmon. Serve your salmon with a side of sushi rice and watch the rave reviews come in!</p>
